Usage of the tsdnsserver
########################


Getting Started
+++++++++++++++

1. Edit the settings file called tsdns_settings.ini
2. Insert any query=result pairs into the new text file, below is an example

----example tsdns_settings.ini----
foo.bar.host.com=123.34.45.132:5437
baz.host.com=44.23.55.109.245:11555
qux.host.com=111.222.33.44:5556
myotherhostname.com=1.2.3.4
*=14.5.11.66:$PORT
----------end of example----------

In the example the server the TSDNS server is running on should be reachable
via "host.com" and via "myotherhostname.com", the "foo.bar", "baz", "qux"
prefixes need not be part of a registered domain name, but can be chosen
arbitrarily.
If you ommit the port on the right side the default TS3 port (9987) is assumed.
If you put "$PORT" in place of a real port the connecting client will use the
port defined on client side.
If you put "*" on the left side you define a default answer that will be given
whenever none of the other answers match. In the example if somebody connects
to "host.com:4500" the TSDNS server will direct them to "14.5.11.66:4500", as
it cannot find "host.com" on the left side it uses the default entry.
A line like "*=1.2.3.4:$PORT" is good practise to keep backwards compatibility
in case you are migrating your users from using "domain:port" to connect to
TSDNS.

3. Run the tsdnsserver executable. It will report (on the console) any errors
in the ini file and if all is ok tell you howmany entries it scanned.


Updating the tsdns_settings.ini while the tsdnsserver is running
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Simply edit the tsdns_settings.ini file, and then start a (second) tsdnsserver,
but this time with the parameter "--update" appended to the command line. The
newly started executable will terminate immediatly, and the old "main" tsdns
server will note something similar to:
"Scanned tsdns_settings.ini, number of entries: 56"


"Exception: Function not implemented" during startup
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This error can occur when the interprocess communication that is needed for the
"--update" parameter to work fails. The reason is often that tmpfs is not
mounted to /dev/shm

To fix this problem, the following commands or file edits need to be done as
root user (or using something like sudo). This is a temporary fix until your
next reboot.

mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /dev/shm

Now, to make sure this mount is done automatically upon reboot edit the file
/etc/fstab and add the line:

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0
