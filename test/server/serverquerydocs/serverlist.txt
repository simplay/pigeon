Usage: serverlist [-uid] [-all] [-short] [-onlyoffline]

Displays a list of virtual servers including their ID, status, number of 
clients online, etc. If you're using the -all option, the server will list all 
virtual servers stored in the database. This can be useful when multiple server 
instances with different machine IDs are using the same database. The machine 
ID is used to identify the server instance a virtual server is associated with.

The status of a virtual server can be either online, offline, booting up, 
shutting down and virtual online. While most of them are self-explanatory, 
virtual online is a bit more complicated. Whenever you select a virtual server 
which is currently stopped, it will be started in virtual mode which means you 
are able to change its configuration, create channels or change permissions,
but no regular TeamSpeak 3 Client can connect. As soon as the last ServerQuery
client deselects the virtual server, its status will be changed back to 
offline.

Example:
   serverlist
   virtualserver_id=1 virtualserver_port=9987 virtualserver_status=online 
   virtualserver_clientsonline=6...
   error id=0 msg=ok
