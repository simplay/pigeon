TeamSpeak 3 Server :: ServerQuery
(c) TeamSpeak Systems GmbH

ServerQuery is a command-line interface built into the TeamSpeak 3 Server which 
allows powerful scripting and automation tools to be built based on the exact 
same instruction set and functionality provided by the TeamSpeak 3 Client. For 
example, you can use scripts to automate the management of virtual servers or 
nightly backups. In short, you can perform operations more efficiently by using 
ServerQuery scripts than you can by using a user interface.
